# React Carousel

A JavaScript carousel built using React and Redux. Requires NodeJS v4.4.5 or higher.

## Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies via npm.

```
npm install
```

## Starting A Dev Server

You can run a webpack dev server which will serve up the bundled js/css and can be browsed to using the url `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

```
npm start
```

This will give hot reloading of React components, so no need to restart to server.
